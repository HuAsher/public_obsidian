I have started to hear talk of an AI bubble in different circles. To generalize, I think I've heard this from people knowledgeable generally about the topic, but not in the tech sphere and not from laymen.

For now I'm thinking AI is a bubble and will pop but not yet.

# Pop Criteria

1. laymen talk about how AI is overvalued and the investment doesn't make sense
2. major pullback catalyst (people will first take money out of speculative AI)
