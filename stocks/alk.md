# Initial Reason For Interest
I'm doing that thing again where I trade based purely on what the chart looks like, but this time is different... right? See, this time the chart clearly does big spikes up and down periodically, and it looks like it's right at the bottom. 
# Strategy
Maybe leg in, maybe just buy? Kinda looks like it's gonna run any second now.
