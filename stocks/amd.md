# Initial Reason For Interest
Nvidia has been the only option for training AI for a while (CUDA was ubiquitous, I wasn't even aware of the AMD alternative). I believe this is changing for a few reasons (back in early 2025.)
1. Deepseek made huge waves in the AI space. They did really cool engineering in order to get every drop of computing power out of their lower quality AI chips (restricted chip export to China.) Part of this cool engineering was actually working on the layer below CUDA, which in theory means CUDA is not as necessary for training AI.
2. US and China have entered / ramped up an AI arms race. China has multiple groups trying to build AI to match the US, and the US has focused on chip export restrictions to China. This will create incentive for China to develop comparable AI chips used to train AI, again reducing the amount Nvidia is required.
# Re-evaluate Oct/Nov 2025
NVDA market cap: **4526.12B**
AMD market cap: **410.45B**
Am hearing chatter about an [AI bubble](concepts/ai_bubble.md)
Doesn't really show signs of slowing down for now.
I think the two concerns are the AI bubble "popping", and some third party GPU creator having a big unexpected breakthrough in some way, pushing out AMD.
I remain a believer for now.
