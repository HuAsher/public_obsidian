# Initial Reason For Interest
Same as [FI](stocks/fi.md), I saw someone online playing it. I've kinda forgotten the reasoning now when writing this, but I had something of an idea at the time. I think essentially it was a combination of a few things, I can't remember them.

# Conclusion
It worked out for me so yay, but I should pay a bit more attention to the reasons and maybe write them down. Though it's a bit chaotic because this was happening at the market open, so can't be too pressed about it.
