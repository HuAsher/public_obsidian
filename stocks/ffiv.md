# Initial Reason For Interest
FFIV experienced a [cybersecurity incident](https://www.board-cybersecurity.com/incidents/tracker/20251015-f5-inc-cybersecurity-incident/), and in response the stock had two drops.
1. Sentiment for the company dropped because of the cybersecurity incident, which is normal for a lot of companies.
2. They announced an expected drop for Q4 because of the incident, but the latest info I see is that it hasn't yet impacted them.
# Why Invest
I think cybersecurity incidents tend to affect public sentiment for a while, but tend to have a small long term impact to companies, especially depending on the company's response.
I am betting on FFIV recovering well within the 2 months. 
# Response To Incident
```We have engaged **CrowdStrike**, **Mandiant**, and other leading cybersecurity experts to support this work, and we are actively engaged with **law enforcement** and our **government partners**. ```
```We have released updates for **BIG-IP**, **F5OS**, **BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes**, **BIG-IQ**, and **APM clients**. ```
```
Since initiating our incident response efforts, we have:

- Rotated credentials and strengthened access controls across our systems.
- Deployed improved inventory and patch management automation, as well as additional tooling to better monitor, detect, and respond to threats.
- Implemented enhancements to our network security architecture.
- Hardened our product development environment, including strengthening security controls and monitoring of all software development platforms.

We are taking additional actions to further strengthen the security of our products:

- Continuing code review and penetration testing of our products with support from both NCC Group and IOActive to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in our code.
- Partnering with CrowdStrike to extend Falcon EDR sensors and Overwatch Threat Hunting to BIG-IP for additional visibility and to strengthen defenses. An early access version is available to BIG-IP customers and F5 is providing supported customers with a free Falcon EDR subscription through October 14, 2026.

# Thoughts So Far
5 Nov
Doesn't look like it's working out. Honestly don't really get it, they're doing the things right, but it continues to fall. Maybe the rebound is longer term than I was expecting, maybe it's really affecting this one, maybe it's reflecting the market being negative right now, maybe investors are focusing on higher potential growers, don't know.
Will keep holding for now, I have more cash if there are others I'm interested in.
