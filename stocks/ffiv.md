# Initial Reason For Interest
FFIV experienced a [cybersecurity incident](https://www.board-cybersecurity.com/incidents/tracker/20251015-f5-inc-cybersecurity-incident/), and in response the stock had two drops.
1. Sentiment for the company dropped because of the cybersecurity incident, which is normal for a lot of companies.
2. They announced an expected drop for Q4 because of the incident, but the latest info I see is that it hasn't yet impacted them.
# Why Invest
I think cybersecurity incidents tend to affect public sentiment for a while, but tend to have a small long term impact to companies, especially depending on the company's response.
I am betting on FFIV recovering well within the 2 months. 
# Response To Incident
```We have engaged **CrowdStrike**, **Mandiant**, and other leading cybersecurity experts to support this work, and we are actively engaged with **law enforcement** and our **government partners**. ```
```We have released updates for **BIG-IP**, **F5OS**, **BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes**, **BIG-IQ**, and **APM clients**. ```
```
Since initiating our incident response efforts, we have:

- Rotated credentials and strengthened access controls across our systems.
- Deployed improved inventory and patch management automation, as well as additional tooling to better monitor, detect, and respond to threats.
- Implemented enhancements to our network security architecture.
- Hardened our product development environment, including strengthening security controls and monitoring of all software development platforms.

We are taking additional actions to further strengthen the security of our products:

- Continuing code review and penetration testing of our products with support from both NCC Group and IOActive to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in our code.
- Partnering with CrowdStrike to extend Falcon EDR sensors and Overwatch Threat Hunting to BIG-IP for additional visibility and to strengthen defenses. An early access version is available to BIG-IP customers and F5 is providing supported customers with a free Falcon EDR subscription through October 14, 2026.
