# Initial Reason For Interest
Investigating a potential oversell.
# Is It An Oversell Or Reasonable?
I cannot figure out why the huge drop happened. It seems to be in response to Q3 earnings, but the earnings seem fine. There was a big spike up in response to Q2 earnings, so maybe those earnings went super well and the market had priced in another overperformance?
# Why Invest
If this were real life I would say "I don't really understand what's going on here, so I'm staying out." But it's fake money so YOLO. I don't believe this drop makes sense, prove me wrong.
