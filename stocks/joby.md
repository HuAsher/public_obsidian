A person I follow online is big on JOBY, they have been holding it for a while.
# Thoughts On It
Eh. It's purely speculative, they're trying to develop an electric VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) air taxi. Frankly I'm not sure I'm even a believer in the company if today they announced they've made the product and it's commercially viable. Obviously the stock will go up if that happens, but will it actually be a profitable business? Why not a ferry or gondola or taxi cab etc? This will be pretty expensive because of the tech, so it can't just be a normal taxi. I dunno. Probably won't enter for now.
