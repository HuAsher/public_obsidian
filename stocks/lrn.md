# Initial Reason For Interest
Was looking for oversells might rebound a bit. Spotted this one of the day of the big drop, put it on my watchlist and waited for what I thought would be a good entry.
# Trades

# Conclusion
It kinda worked out for me, I could've done a bit better with it, but I was sleeping during the entire market the few days I should've bought, so I want to try again.
