# Initial Reason For Interest
I looked at insider trading for it. There is a sea of insider selling, which is normal, but for the first time in at least a year there is insider buying. By two people, the director and CFO. My understanding is the CFO is a good one to follow because as the chief FINANCIAL officer they have a good idea of the money. It also has good fundamentals, solid [P/E](concepts/price_earnings.md), analyst recommendation, and it has a dividend, so it seems like a stock that can't lose, and might be about to win.
Also, a bit odd but I've seen a ton of insider buying in regional banks lately. This is just another in a large trend. Maybe it's because of the interest rate being lowered? I don't know but the people who know seem to be investing now so it can't be that bad right?
