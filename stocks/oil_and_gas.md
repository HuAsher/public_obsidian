# Initial Reason For Interest
NRT and MPC seem to have been strong for a bit.
# Why Invest
Honestly I need to learn more, I just see they are doing strong right now and want to play them. Also they are a bit separated from my other investments, so a bit of diversification is nice. I do need to learn if they are impacted by AI because they are energy and that's relevant for data centers. If that's the case it wouldn't be diversification and I would be deterred.

# Thoughts So Far
So NRT kinda worked out for me, but I'm down on MPC. I think the lesson is the same as other ones I bought on the "technicals." I don't know the technicals and should learn if I want to do that.
