# Initial Reason For Interest
Got this one from someone online again. The reasoning given is that multiple times in the past it has reacted poorly to bad earnings like now, but then gaps back up because it is a "retail investor darling." Meaning that people like to invest in it regardless of these negative signs. It was pointed out that this time could be different because with the [government shutdown](concepts/gov_shutdown.md) now going on so long people may be less likely to get involved with this stuff.
# Strategy
Eh, maybe throw in 1k or something just to see what happens.
