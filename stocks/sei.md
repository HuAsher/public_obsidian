# Initial Reason For Interest
I think this one was because it was highly recommended by analysts and it seemed to be performing well. Not great reasons.

# Thoughts So Far
Not really enjoying this one, I think it's because I don't have a clear plan, so not going up is the only feedback I have. I think it still looks like a good hold to me, but also I'm establishing I'm not good at that.
